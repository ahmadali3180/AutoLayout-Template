# About Project

This project is a SignIn/Register screen UI, made in Swift and UIKit. In this project I have ceated three screens that you can use to save up your time while developing an app that needs authentication. 

### Points to note

1. This project does not contain any custom icons, animations, vectors etc.
2. This project is only a skeleton template for future projects.

### What you get
1. 3 Screens with custom UI
(SignIn, Register, SignIn with social accounts)

2. All the IBOutlets and Buttons linked in respective ViewControllers.
3. AutoLayout so you dont have a headache setting up the constraints.


### How to run
